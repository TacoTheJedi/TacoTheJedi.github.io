          <h3>What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?</h3>
          <div class = "col-7">
          <img src = "img/droidattack.jpg" alt="What about the droid attack of the Wookiees?"></div>
          <div class = "col-5">
              <div class = "jedan">
          <p>This one is probably my favorite Star Wars meme. I remember being in eighth grade thinking this was really funny for some reason. Looking back, it's just random Gen Z Star Wars humor. What a time to be alive. </p></div></div>
          <h3>It's over Anakin, I have the high ground</h3>
          <div class = "col-7">
          <img src = "img/highground.jpg" alt="It's over Anakin, I have the high ground"></div>
          <div class = "col-5">
              <div class = "dva">
          <p>Throwback to seventh grade to when me and some guy in my English class would just try to get on the highest surfaces possible and declare being the high ground. Charlie, if for whatever reason you're reading this, I am and always will be the high ground. I think it's funny that this is why Darth Vader had to wear a silly little outdated space suit, because he couldn't get on a higher elevation. Also Obi-Wan is my favorite character, it just makes sense.</p></div></div>
          <h3>I don't like sand, it's coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere</h3>
          <div class = "col-7">
          <img src = "img/sand.jpeg" alt="I don't like sand, it's coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere "></div>
          <div class = "col-5">
              <div class = "tri">
          <p>This is why I call Anakin Skywalker the sand man. Every time I watch this line in <em>Attack of the Clones</em> I always burst out laughing. It's just hilarious and totally random. What kind of rizz does Anakin need to have to talk about sand and then get the girl of his dreams. I don't understand. Also since I'm from San Diego, I use this quote a lot to talk about why I don't like going to the beach. Back in the day before the strike, I even did this quote for my Assignment 4.</p></div></div>
          <h3>Hello there</h3>
          <div class = "col-7">
          <img src = "img/hellothere.jpg" alt="Hello there"></div>
          <div class = "col-5">
              <div class = "cetri">
          <p>This got memed out of oblivion back in the day. I don't understand why it's funny, maybe its that random Gen Z humor again. But, the different variations that this meme had were pretty interesting and its cool to see how far the fandom was able to take it.</p></div></div>
          <h3>I am the senate</h3>
          <div class = "col-7">
          <img src = "img/senate.jpg" alt="I am the senate"></div>
          <div class = "col-5">
              <div class = "pet">
          <p>This one is pretty silly goofy because Palpatine just declared himself the overlord of the Star Wars political system and then did a funny little scream and a sick spin. What a wonderful memorable way to spend your time before you become a wrinkly old man forever. Also, the amount of times I spent in the summer between seventh and eighth grade trying to recreate the spin jump while diving into pools is insane. I have multiple videos on my phone, still. It's been five to six years.</p></div></div>
