      <p>Natalija Plavšić is a Serbian and Mexican film director. She is currently a student at Columbia College Chicago majoring in Film and Television and minoring in Game Design. Natalija has worked on several films as a director, most notably <em>A Day in the Life: Quarantine Edition</em> (2020), <em>A Choice</em> (2022), and <em>A Blind Date</em> (2023). She has also been a production assistant on several movies and a set dresser. Natalija also does commission work, which most notably got featured on Serbian TV channels Prva and N1 for her work for the Serbian Cultural Center of San Diego. Her film, <em>A Choice</em> (2022) was featured in her high school's annual arts magazine.</p>
      <p>Natalija's love for Star Wars began when she was ten. She saw the <em>The Force Awakens</em> (2015) in theaters for the first time and started becoming slowly obsessed with Star Wars. By the time she was in seventh grade, she was very deep into the lore and was actively listening to the soundtracks. Star Wars introducted Natalija to the world of filmmaking and inspired her to start directing her own films.</p>
