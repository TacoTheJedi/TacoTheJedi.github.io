      <h3><b>#11:</b> <em>Episode VIII: The Last Jedi</em> (2017)</h3>
          <div class = "ten>">
      <img src= "img/tljposter.jpeg" alt="The Last Jedi movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>This movie had a lot of hype surrounding it. <em>The Force Awakens</em> (2015) ended with a massive cliffhanger, Rey handing Luke Skywalker's lightsaber back to him after he exiled himself on the remote planet of Ahch-To. So naturally, of course, many fans started to speculate what would happen next, and people had high expectations.</p>
      <p>I was in seventh grade when this movie came out. I remember being super hyped about it. I even saw the movie on the day it came out, and didn't even look at Instagram for two days before that to avoid spoilers. And when it came out, I was disappointed. I was surprised that this was the fate that was chosen upon the Resistance. I was expecting some massive space battle or Luke going back to help the Resistance. But instead, we got the Canto Bight arc. I thought it was boring and took away from the actual storyline, which is already lacking in interest.</p>
      <p>But like any film, <em>The Last Jedi</em> had some cool parts. The part where Kylo Ren and Rey defeated Snoke was pretty cool. I thought we would finally get to see who Snoke really was (but turns out we had to wait another two years). I also thought they would reveal Rey's parents (another thing we waited two years for), but they didn't they just used a metaphor that she had to raise herself. I really enjoyed the cinematography and the use of the color red towards the end. Overall, I wish this movie lived up to the hype surrounding it. And it was fun reliving this time of my life again in this review. Except for being sad for a while because they KILLED OFF LUKE SKYWALKER</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 3/10</b></h5></div>

          <h3><b>#10:</b> <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em> (1999)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/tpmposter.jpeg" alt="The Phantom Menace movie poster"> </div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>I remember watching this movie for the first time back when I was 10 and slowly getting into Star Wars after watching <em>The Force Awakens</em> (2015) for the first time. This was my introduction to the prequels, which I originally hated. I thought, and still think, that this movie is boring for the most part. The opening is ok, I guess, but once they meet Jar Jar, that is when things go downhill. Jar Jar is my least favorite Star Wars character, I think he is annoying. No hate to Ahmed Best, he was doing his job and he killed it at what George Lucas envisioned his character to be.</p>
      <p>The reasons why this movie could have been better is because of the pod racing scene. It takes up way too much time in the movie and it's just boring. I usually find myself on my phone when this scene comes up. But I have to give it to George Lucas and the people who made this movie because they did a good job on CGI and special effects. It was ahead of its time, and I wasn't even alive to judge that. But my favorite scene in the movie, without a doubt, is the fight between Qui Gon, Obi Wan, and Darth Maul. This scene was amazing! I loved the fighting and the music. "Duel of the Fates" is the best song off of the soundtrack for this movie.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 4/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class="second">
      <h3><b>#9:</b> <em>Episode: VII The Force Awakens</em> (2015)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src= "img/tfaposter.jpg" alt="The Force Awakens movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>This movie came out when I was in fifth grade, and it was my introduction to Star Wars. Everyone in my class watched this movie, so out of peer pressure, I went to go see it. And I thought it was the coolest thing ever. This was either the worst, or best decision of my life. Star Wars eventually got me to want to work in the film industry, which is what I am trying to do today. But also I got relentlessly bullied for liking it in middle and high school, which started to affect my mental health. So this movie has a special place, it brought me to this galaxy far far away.</p>
      <p>But as I started watching Star Wars more, I realized that this movie was eerily similar to <em>A New Hope</em> (1977). Yeah, the storylines are different, but they feel weirdly similar. Big powerful regime exists, person from desert who doesn't know their family gets called to action by mysterious droid. It's the same hero's journey but with a different spin to it. It was cool the first time, but then after a while, it just felt like a cashgrab remake of <em>A New Hope</em>.</p>
      <p>What I liked about <em>The Force Awakens</em> is that it introduced new characters and a new story to the Star Wars universe. But also I don't like that the galaxy never got its happily ever after, after the fall of the Empire. I gotta give it to JJ Abrams for putting in a nice cliffhanger at the end of the movie that sets up the rest of the sequels, but I didn't like waiting for two years to be disappointed and wait another two years to know what actually happened.</p><br><h5><b>Rating 4.5/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "third">
      <h3><b>#8:</b> <em>Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker</em> (2019)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src= "img/trosposter.jpeg" alt="The Rise of Skywalekr movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>Ah, the final movie of the Skywalker saga. What a somewhat satisyfing ending. I remember crying about fourteen times in the theater when I saw this for the first time. I saw it a day before its initial release. I was in ninth grade, just started high school, and getting the worst type of bullying because the people in high school bullied you because they <em>actually</em> wanted to hurt your feelings, not because they were dumbasses who didn't know better. And this movie made me so sad that I was crying all day the next day at school (which was the last day before winter break too).</p>
      <p>I didn't really feel the hype around this movie, especially because of the backlash that <em>The Last Jedi</em> (2017) released. I remember vividly seeing the massive divide that started in the Star Wars community because of the reception of <em>The Last Jedi</em>. The Star Wars fandom was in shambles when <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> came out. It was barely coming back together because <em>The Mandalorian</em> had just started airing. I remember the day that they dropped the trailer for this movie. I was in eighth grade and I was watching the panel from Star Wars Celebration in my Video Production class. But then the bell rang and I had to sneak my phone in with earbuds to the PE locker room (phones were banned). So I checked my phone one last time before going out to PE and got the notification that the trailer dropped. I ran into the bathroom and watched the trailer. After class, I snuck my best friend with me in the stall so we could watch the trailer together. I held her feet up against the stall walls so people wouldn't suspect anything weird was going on. That's when the hype started.</p>
      <p>And this movie delivered better than <em>The Last Jedi</em>. The story was much darker, and I liked it. I'm going to say something controversial: this is the best sequel movie there is. I thought the story wasn't half bad. But also they didn't need to bait us into thinking they killed Chewbacca. And, I didn't like how they brough back Palpatine, that was pretty unecessary. It's cool for the lore, but if you look at the story logically, it didnt need to happen. Also, this soundtrack dropped BANGERS, probably John Williams' best work in the sequels, besides <em>The Force Awakens</em>. </p> <br> <h5><b>Rating: 6/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class ="fourth">
      <h3><b>#7:</b> <em>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</em> (1983)</h3>
          <div class= "ten">
      <img src="img/rotjposter.jpeg" alt="Return of the Jedi movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>What we thought was the ending to the Skywalker saga, and given a truly happy and satisfying ending. Only for it to be changed up by Disney 36 years later. <em>Return of the Jedi</em> is my least favorite movie from the original trilogy. And don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy.</p>
      <p>The majority of this rating has to do with me not liking the beginning of the movie. Yeah, we had to rescue Han Solo from Jabba's palace, but it just dragged on. It was essential to the plot I guess, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Also I didnt like  the slave Leia costume, I thought it was kind of weird. The best thing we got out of that scene though was Max Rebo, hes such a neat looking character. And, this is my least favorite soundtrack out of all the Star Wars movies. I can't find a song on this soundtrack I would say I truly enjoy. But since I have more movies to rank, I just had to put <em>Return of the Jedi</em> in a somewhat lower position to accomodate the rest.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 7/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class ="fifth">
      <h3><b>#6:</b> <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> (2016)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/r1poster.jpeg" alt="Rogue One movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>I was slowly becoming into Star Wars when <em>Rogue One</em> came out, so I can't really say I remember a time being really hyped for this movie. I did see it in theaters with my cousins though, because they wanted to see it and so did I. I do remember watching the ending in my eighth grade math class so many times because it was so cool to watch (and the music was amazing too). But this was one of the best movies that Disney put out with Star Wars.</p>
      <p><em>Rogue One</em> introduced us to totally new characters from different parts of the galaxy and being able to mesh them with already existing characters. This movie was a setup for <em>A New Hope</em> (1977) and it does a beautiful job by using the MacGuffin of the Death Star plans to center the story around. And, it also shows the Rebellion in a different light. Although they are teh good guys, they weren't always trusting in plans that would get them to the next step of dismantling the Empire. We also see other reasons that makes people want to fight the Empire. And this even brought up <em>Andor</em>, one of Disney's latest Star Wars shows, which is centered around Cassian Andor, one of the characters from Rogue One</p>
      <p>The visuals for <em>Rogue One</em> were also incredible. Each scene and location had a beautiful color palette that was aesthetically pleasing. Not to forget to mention that the soundtrack was absolutely beautiful, it is one of my favorite Star Wars soundtracks.</p><br><h5><b>Rating 8/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "sixth">
      <h3><b>#5:</b> <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> (2018)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
              <img src="img/soloposter.jpeg" alt="Solo movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p><em>Solo</em> was literally my obsession in the summer and fall of 2018. It came out in May, and I just could not stop thinking about it. I still want to see a sequel. Unfortunately, this movie had very poor marketing, we didn't even get a trailer until the Super Bowl, which was three months before its release. Solo has the best soundtrack out of all the Star Wars movies. You can kill me for that, I don't care. Maybe its because of it reminds me of the time in my life where I was obsessed with this movie. I rememebr going on a field trip with my digital art class to Balboa Park to see the Museum of Photographic Arts (a museum who's youth exhibition did not accept my films for three years in a row, shame on them) and I just kept playing the <em>Solo</em> soundtrack. I spent that entire summer absolutely enamored with this movie. I hated Qi'ra's Betrayal of Han, and waited for a sequel (that we still need) announcement. I kept thinking of what could be next in this story that leads Han up to <em>A New Hope</em>. I read the Han Solo legends books, and they were able to do that perfectly, and hopefully Disney has something similar in store for canon.</p>
      <p>This is arguably one of the more fun stories of Star Wars. It talks about escape, freedom, love, and many other things. Seventh and eighth grade me ate this up. I thought the story was amazing. Also, I feel embarassed to admit this (but I told my dad about a year ago, so less now) but my first celebrity crush was on Alden Ehrenreich, I love him so much. Everyone thought I was delusional because they all thought he was ugly, but my fourteen year old self thought he was very good looking. Besides that, I think <em>Solo</em> is <b>the best</b> Disney Star Wars movie (sorry <em>Rogue One</em>). It's also very underrated because of the poor marketing Disney had on this movie, and also it came out right after <em>The Last Jedi</em>, which received a large backlash from the Star Wars community. Writing about this makes me realize I need a <em>Solo</em> rewatch. Daniel if you're reading this, queue it up on Disney+ real quick.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 9/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "seventh">
      <h3><b>#4:</b> <em>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em> (2002)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/aotcposter.jpeg" alt="Attack of the Clones movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>It might be a big surprise to you, but when I first saw <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, it was my least favorite Star Wars movie. I hated it with a burning passion for years. I thought the writing was awful, and all the love scenes with Anakin and Padme were cringe. In sixth grade Star Wars club, they paused the movie at a point where Anakin and Padme were rolling around in the grass on Naboo, and they were in a silly situation when pause was pressed. It is the funniest memory I have from this movie. The best memory comes from a tradition I have with my boyfriend watching <em>Attack of the Clones</em> every Valentine's Day because I used to do that when I was alone and conviced I'd die alone, but now it's a fun viewing I look forward to every year. But it ranks number four on this list, why must it be this good?</p>
      <p>Over time, I came to realize <em>Attack of the Clones</em> isn't even half bad. The fun begins once Anakin and Padme get to Tatooine. Well it was fun with Obi Wan's side plot to Kamino to find the clone army. But I hated the scenes on Naboo, it ruined the whole movie for me. The beginning was also kind of interesting, but still somewhat boring. Capturing the person that tried to kill Padme was boring in my opinion, but it needs to happen for the story to continue. It's a great setup for the <em>Clone Wars</em> TV show, and <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> (2005).</p>
      <p><em>Attack of the Clones</em> is also a great source for memes! "I don't like sand, its coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere" is a classic. It's a goldmine, if im being honest. Also, the soundtrack is really good. My favorite Star Wars song comes from this soundtrack ("Love Pledge and the Arena" if you're curious). I remember going to Vegas for the first time and listening to this so much on the ride there.</p><br><h5><b>Rating 9.2/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "eighth">
      <h3><b>#3:</b> <em>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</em> (1980)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/esbposter.jpeg" alt="Empire Strikes Back movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is usually at the top of most people's Star Wars movie lists. And yeah, number three is pretty good, but theres better movies in my opinion. A lot happens, that sets up for <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, but also it's a great pickup for <em>A New Hope</em> (1977). George Lucas probably didn't intend to make a sequel when he finished <em>A New Hope</em>, that's where theres such a happy ending, but also the Empire still exists when the movie ends. And <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is a great continuation of this story.</p>
      <p>Some things I do not like about <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is that the battle on Hoth is kind of boring, and the ending is a cliffhanger trying to be a satisfying ending. I think why a lot of people think it's super cool, is because of the line "No, I am your father", commonly thought to be "Luke, I am your father". Biggest plot twist in cinema history, some might say. And the setup to get us to that point is cool too, we meet Yoda, the guy I would say is my boyfriend when family would ask if I had one when I was younger (that is none of your business, especially when I was in my early teens). Also, I thought the soundtrack was pretty mid, except for "Darth Vader's March" aka "The Imperial Theme", that is the best song on the soundtrack.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 9.3/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "ninth">
      <h3><b>#2:</b> <em>Episode IV: A New Hope</em> (1977)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/anhposter.jpeg" alt="A New Hope movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>The one that started it all, <em>A New Hope</em>. Where would I even be without this movie. I think <em>A New Hope</em> is a perfect example of the Hero's Journey. It's the example that I used in my ninth grade english class when were talking about <em>The Odyssey</em>. But George Lucas tells the story in a unique way that captures the audience. We see a new world no one could ever think of, but now, we cannot live without.</p>
      <p><em>A New Hope</em> is my favorite movie from the original trilogy. Sue me, I don't care. The story is easy to follow and fun to watch. It is so ahead of its time and you can feel it. From costume and set design to special effects. You felt like you were a part of the future. I love always being sucked into this new world every time I watch this movie. Also, the soundtrack is incredible, one of my favorite songs, "Throne Room and End Title" comes from this soundtrack.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 9.8/10</b></h5></div></div>
          <div class = "tenth">
      <h3><b>#1:</b> <em>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em> (2005)</h3>
          <div class = "ten">
      <img src="img/rotsposter.jpeg" alt="Revenge of the Sith movie poster"></div>
          <div class = "col-7">
      <p>A lot of big things happened in 2005. I was born. My parents said I emerged from the womb smiling, not crying. They knew from that first smile that this is where the party began. And two months later, on the big screen, Anakin would then say "this is where the fun begins". I'm not saying this is a coincidence or anything, but it kind of makes sense that George Lucas would drop this banger two months after I was born.</p>
      <p><em>Revenge of the Sith</em> is without a doubt the darkest Star Wars movie. We see the downfall of Anakin and the Jedi Order and the rise of Darth Vader and the Empire. Watching all this go down is beautiful and painfully sad at the same time. I love seeing the fight between Anakin and Obi Wan and seeing best friends turn to enemies at the same time. All the emotional setup in the prequels just fell apart in this movie to set up the original trilogy. I love it.</p>
      <p> Not to mention how this movie is a massive meme gold mine. Literally every scene has a meme. But my favorite is: "what about the droid attack on the wookiees". Thirteen year old me thought it was hilarious for some reason. I also think the high ground meme is iconic (if you know you know). Its what made me fall in love with this movie in the first place. Also, the soundtrack is so depressing, but good. I can cry on command if you played the song they play during Order 66.</p><br><h5><b>Rating: 10/10</b></h5></div></div>
