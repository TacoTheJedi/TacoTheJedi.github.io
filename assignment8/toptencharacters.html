      <h2>Natalija's Top 10 Favorite Characters</h2>
      <h3><b>#10:</b> Grogu</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src="img/grogu.jpeg" alt="Grogu"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "one">
      <p>GROGU IS SOOOOO CUTEEEE!! I love him so much!! Ok seriously, he's just a 50 year old baby with superpowers that he uses in the most critical moments. But who wouldn't love him? I would put him higher on the list but also, all he does is be a super cute counterpart to the Mandalorian. I love how every character he meets just loves him and wants to take care of him. Lucasfilm please hire me to direct an episode of the Mandalorian just so I could get to hang out with him too.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#9:</b> Qui-Gon Jinn</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src= "img/quigon.png" alt="Qui-Gon Jinn"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "two">
      <p>Qui-Gon Jinn's run in Star Wars was short. Just as we started becoming attached to him in <em>The Phantom Menace</em> (1999), he got killed off. But over the summer I read the book <em>Master and Apprentice</em> that follows a storyline of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan many years before the events of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. I came to appreciate Qui-Gon's character even more because I saw a whole other layer to his character. He is wise, but not all knowing. His character arc proved that there is still a lot for him to learn as a jedi master, and as a former apprentice of Count Dooku. Also, he had a cool fight scene against Darth Maul in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. And, if it weren't for his persistence on training Anakin, maybe the events of Star Wars wouldn't have happened.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#8:</b> Darth Maul</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src = "img/darthmaul.jpeg" alt= "Darth Maul"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "three">
      <p>If you're deep in the lore, you know that Darth Maul survived the events of <em>The Phantom Menace</em> and goes on to be a great character in the <em>Clone Wars</em> TV show. Darth Maul is a crazy good fighter, and he has a cool weapon, a double bladed red lightsaber. If his legs didnt get cut off, he would have been even better in <em>The Clone Wars</em>. Also, his cameo in <em>Solo</em> (2018) goes hard. I was absolutely not expecting it when I saw the movie for the first time and I am genuinley curious on how he was able to lead the Crimson Dawn. I hope we do get a <em>Solo</em> sequel or prequel, I'd love to see more of his story.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#7:</b> Luke Skywalker</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src = "img/lukeskywalker.jpeg" alt="Luke Skywalker"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "four">
      <p>Luke Skywalker is the character people think of when they think of Star Wars. But his journey started it all. We get to see Luke be a whiny farm boy on Tatooine to a jedi who saved the galaxy from the Empire's rule. He was able to bring back Darth Vader from the darkside. He's a great character in the original trilogy, but in the sequels, his character takes a weird direction. All of a sudden he's wants to go into exile? I understand he has trauma from his jedi academy being burnt down by Kylo Ren, but wouldn't he of all people take that as an opportunity to get stronger? Anyway, I also really like how he interacted with Grogu in <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#6:</b> Anakin Skywalker</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src = "img/anakinskywalker.jpeg" alt="Anakin Skywalker"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "five">
      <p>Anakin is a great jedi, as seen in the final two prequel movies. He's just like me in the sense that he does things first and then later thinks about them. Also, he was pretty cool as Darth Vader (who is my boyfriend's favorite character), but it's debatable that Anakin and Vader are two different characters because in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> (2005), Anakin slowly transforms, emotionally and physically, into Vader. But I like how he is one of the few jedi that actually knew his family, it made him seem a bit more human and empathetic to others.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#5:</b> Chewbacca</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src = "img/chewbacca.jpeg" alt= "Chewbacca"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "six">
      <p>Chewie is a real one. He was Han's Day 1 (kind of). Han helped Chewie escape from being used as a torture element. And from then on, he was the most loyal friend. And Chewie shows this loyalty to anyone that is his friend. I would love to have Chewbacca as a friend, he would always have my back. Also, he looks like he gives the best hugs (sorry Daniel).</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#4:</b> R2-D2</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src="img/r2d2.jpeg" alt="R2-D2"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "seven">
      <p>R2-D2 is a funny little droid. He is useful, but also causes a little mischief. I love how he is always messing with C3-PO, they are just besties like that and I love it. Also, he was weirdly OP in the prequels, which was cool. He was able to kill a bunch of droids that were covered in oil just by flying over them, how epic! Also, he is the only one in the entire Star Wars saga that knows what's going on because he never got his memory wiped.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#3:</b> Princess Leia</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src="img/leia.jpeg" alt="Princess Leia"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "eight">
      <p>Leia is the cool female character in the Star Wars movies that you see and you think "I want to be like her". She does what she wants, and she tells others what to do. She doesn't need saving, she saves others. Also, she killed it in the sequels, still leading the Resistance. What a girlboss! RIP Carrie Fisher, you would have loved this review of your character.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#2:</b> Yoda</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src="img/yoda.jpeg" alt="Yoda"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "nine">
      <p>My three foot, green, thousand year old lover! LOL just kidding. You would know this if you read my movie review of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> (1980). You might think I'm putting him down here because "oh he's wise". Yes, but also hes a great fighter. Did you even see him fight Dooku at the end of <em>Attack of the Clones</em> (2002)? He killed it. Yeah it made him weak, but he fought really good despite being 900+ years old. Also hes super cute, not in a Daniel type way, but in a Grogu way.</p></div></div>
      <h3><b>#1:</b> Obi-Wan Kenobi</h3>
      <div class = "col-5">
      <img src= "img/obiwan.jpeg" alt="Obi-Wan"></div>
      <div class = "col-7">
          <div class = "ten">
      <p>Obi-Wan is just super cool. Mix of wise, great fighting ability, and super cool guy. I loved his spinoff show, you could see what he went through while being a hermit in the desert. Also he was super swag in the prequels. He is the most loyal friend, to Anakin, to Qui-Gon, to anyone. Most importantly, he is the high ground.</p></div></div>
