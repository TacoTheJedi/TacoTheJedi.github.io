          <p>For this project, we added a few features to something we worked on in class. I chose to work on the weather application, using an API key to show the daily weather of cities. I added some data binding to it, so it shows titles, and I also added multiple cities' forecasts because I had a lot of fun working with this weather application. This project worked a lot on C# and the WPF and GUI side of it.</p>
          
	      <p>For the most part, this project was very simple. I had a lot of fun learning how to make a weather application. Since it was done mostly in class, it was easy because we were instructed on how to do it. My biggest challenge was that the data binding was not working despite the code working properly, but a little bit of debugging fixed that.</p>
