      <header>This is implied to be a Serbian Government Website. It is not. Izvini Vuči&#263; :(</header><header>This website will be updated as more information comes out.</header>
      <p><b><ins>Site Title:</ins></b> Министарство Паралелних Универзума (Translation: Ministry of Parallel Universes)</p>
      <p><b><ins>Site logo:</ins></b> It’s a work in progress, but it will be photoshopped</p>
      <p><b><ins>About:</ins></b> Work in progress but here is the general idea: Talk about Natalija Plav&#353;i&#263;, Serbian film director and overthinker, who came up with this theory. Make up a lie about how the Serbian government loved this theory and employed Serbia’s greatest living scientists to do discovery on parallel universes.</p>
      <p><b><ins>3 pieces of “research” writing:</ins></b></p>
      <p>1. Scientific proof and logical existence of Parallel Universes</p>
      <p>2. How to travel across Parallel Universes</p>
         <p>3. How to coexist with yourself living in Parallel Universes</p>
      <p><b><ins>A product offered:</ins></b> Pay €1m to join a waitlist to be one of the first people to travel to a Parallel Universe (fake of course, this money is used to finance Vuči&#263; and SNS).</p>
      <p><b><ins>Background images:</ins></b> Since they have to be my own, and I don’t own any, I might just have to photoshop them. Consider this a work in progress.</p>
      <p><b><ins>Found images:</ins></b> Work in progress. I will have to use Google Images.</p>
      <p><b><ins>Videos:</ins></b> A clip from everything, everywhere, all at once and community</p>
      <p><b><ins>Audio/video material:</ins></b> None</p>
