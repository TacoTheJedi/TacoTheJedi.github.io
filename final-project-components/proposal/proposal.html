      <h1> Final Project Proposal</h1>
      <h2> Natalija Plav&#353;i&#263;</h2>
      <p> As a professional overthinker, I spend a lot of time in deep spiraling thoughts. When I am not overthinking about something about my life, I usually think about other things around me. One of my favorite things to think about is my parallel universe theory. Not many people know about it, I do not think I even shared it with my boyfriend, and I tell him everything. This theory is purely my own thoughts. I did no research on other parallel universe theories, unless you count watching <em> Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em> (2022). Watching <em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em> kind of solidified my theory. I had been thinking about parallel universes for a while before watching it. Honestly, I did not even think the movie would be about parallel universes, I was just going in blindly watching all of the Oscar nominated movies. But seeing the parallel universes in <em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em> grew how I thought about parallel universes. The quote “most universes can’t contain human life” (or something along those lines) made the range of universes I think about grow. </p>
      
      <p>How parallel universes work: Think of every decision someone had to make in their lives. Actually, let's go down to the very first decision ever made by a prehistoric person. The 50/50 chance of them doing something or not already opened up an infinite amount of parallel universes on both sides. If the person did not do something, infinite parallel universes open up because of the choices that come after that initial decision. If the person did the thing, the timeline continues, but infinite amounts of parallel universes already exist parallel to that timeline, where some things are slightly altered (ex: hot dog fingers, humans are rocks with googly eyes, or we simply just have no thumbs). I know this sounds super confusing, but bear with me, I have had a hard time coming up with the language for this theory, but it makes sense in my head. </p>
      
      <p> In the parallel universes after decisions happen, things become different. Kind of like in the Community episode where the study group plays Yahtzee. This episode was literally an awakening and confirmation to my parallel universe theory. Every time someone else went to go pick up the pizza, a new timeline would form. But when Abed grabbed the dice and said not to alter the timeline, he never would have made six new timelines. So lets say I chose to minor in Programming rather than Web Development. Well first off, I never would be sitting here taking this class and writing this proposal. My schedule might have been totally different. I may not have met the same people that I have. I wonder how I’m doing in the infinite parallel universes where I chose to do Programming. Your 1 in AP Computer Science A is not being of great service to you there. Also, when I talk about the infinite parallel universes in this scenario, there is the main timeline, where things go as planned, but also the slight variations to how I, the world, or humanity looks like. </p>
      
      <p>I know this sounds super confusing, but it makes sense. For my college applications I made a movie about someone having to make a difficult choice. THERE ARE SPOILERS SO PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION. Here is the <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF37pdJnWOo">link</a> before you proceed</p>
      <p>In this movie, the person decides to either keep or return $100 change they got from a grocery store cashier. The outcome for this movie has been determined, and I will talk about it later. But think of the timelines in that scenario that have been opened if the person returned the $100. He probably would not have met the homeless person at the end of the movie. Now let's go to the homeless person at the end of the movie. He is left to make a choice of either getting food, or alcohol. It is left to the viewer to decide what he chooses. But if he chooses getting food, this opens an infinite amount of new timelines, same goes for if he chooses getting alcohol. But either way, the 50/50 choice still becomes a 100% chance of creating new parallel universes.</p>
      
      <p> How these parallel universes are created is, I don’t know, magic. I like to think I'm fairly decent at basic physics, but to explain multiple universes is too much for someone that has a high school diploma. I need to be a physicist and I am literally in school for a film degree. My understanding of the actual universe is very small, because I don’t do research and a lot of the mathematical concepts are hard for me to understand because I didn’t learn that much in math and I am not academically trained to understand them. So I will leave it up for the physicists to explain this one. Sorry if this was too confusing.</p>
