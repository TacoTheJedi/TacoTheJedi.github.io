          <p>This was an in class tutorial on how to work with delegates and interfaces. We made a world where there were several locations and had several animals at each location that we could interact with.</p>

          <p>The hardest part of this was lists because at the time for me, how a list worked was confusing. I was more comfortable with arrays because I used them a lot in AP Computer Science in high school when we were coding with Java. So using a list that is more flexible, and can hold actual classes was still mind boggling to me. This tutorial helped me realize how flexible lists can be and that they can serve a purpose when you need to store various new instances of classes in a program.</p>
