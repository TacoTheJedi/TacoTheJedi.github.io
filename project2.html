          <p>For this project, we had to make three separate card games that had similar functions but were different games. For the first game, we had to guess the suit of the next card in a deck of 26 cards. For the second game, we had to guess if the number of the next card in a deck of 52 cards would be higher or lower than the original one drawn. For the final game, we had a more complicated game with a dealer and how many points the dealer had with their cards vs the player's. This project used a lot of the object oriented features of C#, such as inheritence, polymorphism, and classes and objects.</p>
