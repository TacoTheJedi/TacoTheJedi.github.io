              <p> It's a meme and a trend to hate Hawaiian pizza, because it's unnatural and this that and the other. The fact of the matter though is that it makes perfect sense. Fruit and cheese combos are very prevalent, using grapes, strawberries, blueberries, and yes, pineapple. Same goes for meats like salami. Charcuterie plates are a thing, y'all.</p>
              <p> The combo of sweet and savory is such a common occurance now, with things like waffles and fried chicken, or fruity sauce being put on savory foods, or fruits in a stirfry. Chocolate dipped potato chips, salted caramel, you name it. The combo of sweet and salt/savory has been around for a long time and is in no way unnatural or unappealing.</p>
              <p> When done right(ish) the pineapple has a sweetness that contrasts just right with the savory, but not so much that it's all you taste. It all synergizes together in perfect harmony. Pizza places all over the world serve this type of pizza. It's not the best by any means, but goddammit it's delicious.</p>

              <h1>Anti Pineapple</h1>
              <p>December 31, 2010. I'm in Mexico City at my aunt's house with my brother, grandparents, aunt and her housekeepers because the rest of the family went out to the Frida Kahlo museum. My aunt decides to order a pizza for us at Pizza Hut. Me and my brother asked for a cheese pizza, and my grandmother asked for a hawaiian pizza. My curious 5 year old mind, never hearing of a hawaiian pizza in my life, I asked my grandmother what it is. She said its a pizza with ham and pineapple. I reply with "ew, who would put pineapple on pizza". </p>
              <p> This story was my intial reaction upon hearing about pineapple on pizza. I was 5. Ever since then, I have brought upon judgement on people who think mixing a fruit with a salty food is perfectly tasty. The argument from this Reddit source explains the normalization of sweet/salty food combinations. Yeah, people do that, and it tastes good if done properly. </p>
              <p>Last week, after my friends convinced me, I tried hawaiian pizza for the first time at the dining hall. (Hi parents who are just finding this out for the first time). Pineapple and pizza DO NOT mix. The Redditor above praises how the sweetness contrasts with the savory. That is what is wrong with hawaiian pizza. It gets sweet and the pineapple juices ruin the best part of a pizza, the sauce. I have to admit, the crunchiness of the pineapple is a plus, but you can easily replicate that with other vegetables that do not subtract from the taste of a pineapple</p>
