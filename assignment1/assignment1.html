          <p>The article “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner is an essay that describes the history and the evolution of the internet and the author’s personal connection towards each stage of internet history and how they felt during certain periods of time. In the beginning, the connection between the user and the website (and internet as a whole) was more intimate. Users were more likely to create their own websites to share their knowledge with the world. People using the internet usually had an understanding of how certain technological aspects of the internet worked because of their close personal relationship with websites that they could have made. “Web 1.0 required users to manually code, design, and manage their own spaces on the net and interact with others on the web in ways such as clicking links, copying an email address, or manually linking to other webpages” (Wagner). As compared to now during modern times, most people do not know how to code up a website, or design their own internet spaces. Wagner often refers to how Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites do not let you customize your profile as much as you could back in the day when MySpace was in existence. This loss of connection between user and interface widened the gap of people who were able to understand the knowledge of the inner workings of the internet. For example, in my family, my parents learned to code in the 80’s and 90’s respectively. They usually tell me and my brother stories about how the early internet was like and how they <em>had</em> to learn a programming language so they could do something useful on it. Me and my brother, both born in the 2000’s found this concept so foreign, because everything on the internet was already set up for us to use without discomfort. </p>
          <p> As time progressed on the internet, older websites started to get shut down, and along with them, their knowledge. “...when a website, especially one that invites mass participation, goes offline or executes a huge dump of its data and resources, it’s as if a smallish Library of Alexandria has been burned to the ground” (Wagner). The way this was phrased made me seem like an era of the internet had been lost or died a little bit. For example, MySpace makes me think of the 2000’s culture because it was a very popular website back then. When it was shut down, Wagner made it seem like a crucial piece of internet culture had died. And in my opinion, it had died. Like previously mentioned, we no longer have the cute customization of personal profiles like we used to. I think in 2020 I would have also wanted a “My Chemical Romance soundbite” to play when you opened up my Instagram profile (Wagner). Erasure of knowledge, or perhaps, culture in this case, shapes the internet into new eras that further separate the user and the interface. As the article kept going, the topics Wagner mentioned started to hit close to home, especially the mention of the Flash shutdown. The quotation “Flash-based, arcade-style video games like those developed by Miniclip or CoolMath4Kids” made me get a little excited because those were websites I spent HOURS on (Wagner). When Flash shut down, I remember there being a period of time (before they started using Flash emulators) where I would spend hours trying to look for revivals of the Papa’s games or Fireboy and Watergirl. When Flash shut down, it felt like a piece of my childhood was gone. This was my burning of the Library of Alexandria. Of course, Wagner and I grew up in different time periods, but the feeling when websites shut down, in this case, become less usable, truly marks the end of an era for the internet. Luckily, Cool Math Games still exists and you can still play most of the games they used to have, but in most cases with older sites, it's harder to revive them. </p>
          <p>Finally, towards the end of the article, Wagner started diving a bit into modern internet history. It felt more relatable because these were moments of the internet I remember and have lived through. Also, she mentioned that some of the humor used by (assuming Gen Z) is arising to become a new trend that could be a new crucial moment of internet history: “It’s important to note here the subversive, deliberately ugly aesthetics of so-called “Weird Facebook” groups, with titles like “Please show to Jim ! ! HA ! ! HA ! !” or “we are all god’s children and he left us in a hot car.” These groups are devoted to niche or surrealist humor, usually mocking the rest of the site’s aging denizens, and often rooted in a similarly vague (and deeply irony-poisoned) anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist ideology as vaporwave.” (Wagner). It feels like my internet reality will one day become internet history and I feel like Wagner was telling their story and passing along the torch for me to recall my own internet history in the time I am alive. </p>
